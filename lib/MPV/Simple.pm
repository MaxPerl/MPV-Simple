=head1 NAME

MPV::Simple - Perl extension for the MPV audio and video player using libmpv

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use MPV::Simple;
    my $ctx = MPV::Simple->new();
    $ctx->initialize;
    $ctx->set_property_string('input-default-bindings','yes');
    $ctx->set_property_string('input-vo-keyboard','yes');
    $ctx->set_property_string('osc','yes');

    $ctx->command("loadfile", "/home/maximilian/Dokumente/perl/MPV-Simple/t/einladung2.mp4");
    while (my $event = $ctx->wait_event(-1)) {
            if ($event->{id} == 7){
                    $ctx->terminate_destroy();
                    last;
            }
    }

    exit 0;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MPV::Simple is simple binding to libmpv/MPV.

=head2 WARNING

The module is in the ALPHA stadium (as well as the libmpv API). API could be changed in the future.

=head2 METHODS

The following methods exist:

=over 4

=item * my $mpv = MPV::Simple->new()
Constructs a new MPV handle

=item * $mpv->initialize();
Initialize an uninitialized mpv instance. If the mpv instance is already running, an error is retuned. This function needs to be called to make full use of the client API if the client API handle was created with new().

=item * $mpv->set_property_string('name','value');
Set a property to a given value. Properties are essentially variables which can be queried or set at runtime. For example, writing to the pause property will actually pause or unpause playback. For true you have to write "yes", for false "no"

=item * $mpv->get_property_string('name','value');
Return the value of the property with the given name as string.

=item * $mpv->observe_property_string('name', reply_userdata);
Get a notification whenever the given property changes. You will receive updates as mpv event MPV_EVENT_PROPERTY_CHANGE. Note that this is not very precise: for some properties, it may not send updates even if the property changed. This depends on the property, and it's a valid feature request to ask for better update handling of a specific property. (For some properties, like ``clock``, which shows the wall clock, this mechanism doesn't make too much sense anyway.)
Observing a property that doesn't exist is allowed. (Although it may still cause some sporadic change events.)
Keep in mind that you will get change notifications even if you change a property yourself. Try to avoid endless feedback loops, which could happen if you react to the change notifications triggered by your own change.
The parameter reply_userdata will be used for the mpv_event.reply_userdata field for the received MPV_EVENT_PROPERTY_CHANGE events. If you have no use for this, pass 0. Also see mpv_unobserve_property().

=item * $mpv->unobserve_property(registered_reply_userdata);
Undo mpv_observe_property(). This will remove all observed properties for which the given number was passed as reply_userdata to mpv_observe_property.

=item * $mpv->command($command, @args);
Send a command to the player. Commands are the same as those used in L<input.conf>, except that this function takes parameters in a pre-split form. The commands and their parameters are documented in input.rst.

=item * $mpv->wait_event($timeout)
Wait for the next event, or until the timeout expires, or if another thread makes a call to mpv_wakeup(). Passing 0 as timeout will never wait, and is suitable for polling.
The internal event queue has a limited size (per client handle). If you don't empty the event queue quickly enough with mpv_wait_event(), it will overflow and silently discard further events. If this happens, making asynchronous requests will fail as well (with MPV_ERROR_EVENT_QUEUE_FULL).

=item * $mpv->terminate_destroy()
Brings the player and all clients down as well, and waits until all of them are destroyed. Returns a hashref containing the event ID and other data.

=head2 Integrating in foreign event loop (especially interaction with GUI's)

In general, the API user should run an event loop in order to receive events. This event loop should call mpv_wait_event(), which will return once a new mpv client API is available. It is also possible to integrate client API usage in other event loops (e.g. GUI toolkits). In the C-API this can be done with the mpv_set_wakeup_callback() function, and then polling for events by calling mpv_wait_event() with a 0 timeout. It is strongly recommended, to use MPV::Simple::Pipe, which runs MPV in a seperate process and sets up everything for you. MPV communicates there with the GUI part through pipes. The MPV process mainly starts an event loop in which it calls mpv_wait_event with a timeout of 0 and looks for new commands.

=head2 Error handling

In MPV 0 and positive return values always mean success, negative values are always errors. So you cannot use C<or die "...:$!\n" with MPV methods. You can use C<MPV::Simple::error_string($status)> on the returned value to get the error reason. Furthermore you can die on an error with C<MPV::Simple::check_error($mpv->command(...)> or print a warning with C<MPV::Simple::warn_error($mpv->command(...)>. Hopefully in newer versions this works more perlish.
